This package is a selection of generalised  small utilities classes for many use-cases, a brief description of each follows.

- A class for easing return of multiple values, implicit handling of args and kwargs and more. 

- A class for executing any 'heavy' function asynchronously any storing results in a bounded queue. 
Note: communication and organisation is costly, intended for heavy processing functions and general queuing.
